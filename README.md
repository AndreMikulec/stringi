# **stringi**

### THE string processing package for *R*


**stringi** is THE *R* package for for very fast, correct, consistent,
and convenient string/text processing in each locale and any native
character encoding. The use of the *ICU* library gives R users a
platform-independent set of functions known to *Java*, *Perl*, *Python*,
*PHP*m and *Ruby* programmers. The package's API was inspired by
Hadley Wickham's [stringr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr)
package.
