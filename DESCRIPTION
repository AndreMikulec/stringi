Title: THE string processing package for R
Description: stringi is THE R package for very fast, correct, consistent,
    and convenient string processing in each locale and any native
    character encoding. The use of the ICU 52.1 library gives R users
    a platform-independent and properly localized toolbox of functions
    inspired by those available in other programming languages, like Java,
    Perl, Python and PHP, as well as Hadley Wickham's stringr package.
