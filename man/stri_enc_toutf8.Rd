\usage{
stri_enc_toutf8(str, is_unknown_8bit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{str}{character vector to be converted}

  \item{is_unknown_8bit}{single logical value, see Details}
}
\value{
Returns a character vector.
}
\description{
Converts character strings with declared marked encodings
to UTF-8 strings.
}
\details{
If \code{is_unknown_8bit} is set to \code{TRUE} and a
string is marked (internally) as being neither ASCII nor
UTF-8-encoded, then all bytecodes > 127 are replaced with
the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (\\Ufffd). Note that the
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER may be interpreted as Unicode
\code{NA} value for single characters. Bytes-marked strings
are treated as 8-bit strings.

Otherwise, R encoding marks is assumed to be trustworthy
(ASCII, UTF-8, Latin1, or Native, see
\code{\link{Encoding}}). Bytes encoding will fail here.

If a string is in UTF-8 and has a byte order mark (BOM),
then BOM will be silently removed from the output string.
