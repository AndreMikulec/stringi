#' Locale Management
#'
#' Locales are most conviniently identified by character strings
#' of the form \code{Language},
#' \code{Language_Country}, or \code{Language_Country_Variang}, e.g. "en_US"
#'
#' ICU4C API DOC: "Because a Locale is just an identifier for a region, 
#' no validity check is performed when you specify a Locale. 
#' If you want to see whether particular resources are available 
#' for the Locale you asked for, you must query those resources. (...)
#' Note: When you ask for a resource for a particular locale, you get
#' back the best available match, not necessarily precisely what you asked for."
#' 
#' ICU4C API DOC: "ICU is implemented as a set of services. One example 
#' of a service is the formatting of a numeric value into a string. 
#' Another is the sorting of a list of strings. When client code wants 
#' to use a service, the first thing it does is request a service object 
#' for a given locale. The resulting object is then expected to perform 
#' its operations in a way that is culturally correct for the requested locale."
#' 
#' "Default locales are available to all the objects in a program. 
#' If you set a new default locale for one section of code, it can affect 
#' the entire program [all other functions from \pkg{stringi}]. Application programs should not set the default locale 
#' as a way to request an international object. The default locale is set 
#' to be the system locale on that platform."
