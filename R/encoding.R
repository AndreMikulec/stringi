#' Character Encodings and \pkg{stringi}
#' 
#' This section explains how we deal with character encoding
#' issues in \pkg{stringi}.
#' 
#' 
#' ICU: Unicode provides a single character set that covers the major 
#' languages of the world, and a small number of machine-friendly encoding
#'  forms and schemes to fit the needs of existing applications and protocols. 
#'  It is designed for best interoperability with both ASCII and ISO-8859-1 
#'  (the most widely used character sets) to make it easier for Unicode to be 
#'  used in almost all applications and protocols.
#'  
#' Hundreds of encodings have been developed over the years, each for small 
#' groups of languages and for special purposes. As a result, 
#' the interpretation of text, input, sorting, display, and storage 
#' depends on the knowledge of all the different types of character sets
#'  and their encodings. Programs have been written to handle either 
#'  one single encoding at a time and switch between them, or to convert
#'   between external and internal encodings.
#'
#'
#' @section UTF-8:
#' 
#' UTF-8 has ASCII as its subset. bytes 0--127 are the same....
#' 
#' Code points larger than 127 are represented by multi-byte sequences
#' (from 2 to 4 bytes)
#' 
#' Not all sequences of bytes are valid UTF-8.
#' 
#' Unicode normalization..... see \code{\link{stri_enc_nfc}}
#' for discussion
#' 
#' ???Most functions in \pkg{stringi} output results in UTF-8???
#' 
#' 
#' @section Encoding Management:
#' 
#' Except for \code{\link{stri_enc_set}}, each function
#' selects default encoding if an empty string or \code{NULL} is given as
#' argument. Generally, an attempt to select an unsupported ICU character
#' encoder will finish with an error.
#' 
#' Please note that apart from given encodings, ICU tries to normalize
#' encoding specifiers.
#' ICU: Converter names are case-insensitive. 
#' Leading zeroes are ignored in sequences of digits (if further digits follow),
#'  and all non-alphanumeric characters are ignored. Thus the strings 
#'  "UTF-8", "utf_8", "u*T@f08" and "Utf 8" are equivalent. 
#'  
#'  
#' @section Character Encodings in R:
#' 
#' Most of the computations in \pkg{stringi} are performed internally
#' using either UTF-8 or UTF-16 encodings. However, we still need to communicate
#' with R somehow and give some trust in how it handles strings.
#' 
#' Basically, R has a very simple encoding-marking mechanism.
#' \code{ASCII} strings consist of bytes with values <= 127.
#' \code{UTF-8} strings...
#' \code{LATIN1} string....
#' \code{BYTES} strings...
#' Sometimes strings have no encoding marks. In this case one should
#' assume that he/she deals with natively-encoded data.
#' 
#' Functions which allow `bytes` encoding marks are very rare in \pkg{stringi},
#' and were carefully selected. These are: \code{\link{stri_enc_toutf8}}
#' (with argument \code{is_unknown_8bit=TRUE}), \code{\link{stri_enc_toascii}},
#' and \code{\link{stri_encode}}.
