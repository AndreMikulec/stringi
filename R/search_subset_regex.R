#' @title
#' Select Elements with a Regex Pattern Match
#'
#' @description
#' This function is roughly equivalent to a call to
#' \code{str[\link{stri_detect_regex}(str, ...)]}.
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str} and \code{pattern}.
#' 
#' The resulting vector is of course always in UTF-8.
#'
#' @param str character vector of strings to search in
#' @param pattern character vector of regular expressions
#' @param opts_regex a named list with \pkg{ICU} Regex settings
#' as generated with \code{\link{stri_opts_regex}}; \code{NULL}
#' for default settings
#'
#' @return Returns a character vector.
#'
#' @examples
#' \donttest{
#' stri_subset_regex(c("stringi R", "REXAMINE", "123"), '[a-z]+')
#' }
#' 
#' @export
#' @family search_subset
#' @family search_regex
