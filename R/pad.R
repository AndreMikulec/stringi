#' Pad a string
#' 
#' Add whitespace at the begining or/and at the end of string.
#' Works like str_pad but faster and it's vectorized not only over s, but 
#' also over width, side and pad. And works with NA value.
#' 
#' @param str character vector
#' @param width pad strings to this minimum width
#' @param side side on which padding character is added (left, right or both)
#' @param pad character vector of single padding character (default is space)
#' @return character vector 
#' @details If string is longer than width, then string is returned unchanged. Look at the example.
#' @examples
#' stri_pad("stringi",10,c("l","r","b"),"#")
#' stri_pad("stringi",5:9,pad="$")
#' stri_pad("1",3,"b",pad=LETTERS)
#' @export
stri_pad <- function(str, width, side = "left", pad = " ") {
   # prepare_arg done internally
   side <- pmatch(side, c("left", "right", "both"),1,T)
   .Call("stri_pad", str, width, side, pad, PACKAGE="stringi")
}
