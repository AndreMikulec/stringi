#' @title
#' Date and Time Formatting
#'
#' @description
#' This function converts a given date/time object
#' to a character vector.
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{time}.
#' 
#' \code{format} may be one of \code{DT_STYLE} or \code{DT_relative_STYLE},
#' where \code{DT} is equal to \code{date}, \code{time}, or \code{datetime},
#' and \code{STYLE} is equal to \code{full}, \code{long}, \code{medium}, or \code{short}.
#' This gives a locale-dependent date and/or time format.
#' Note that currently ICU does not support \code{relative} \code{time} formats,
#' so this flag is currently ignored in such context.
#' 
#' Otherwise, \code{format} is a pattern:
#' a string of characters, where specific strings of characters are replaced
#' with date and time data from a calendar when formatting or used 
#' to generate data for a calendar when parsing.
#' For example, \code{y} stands for the year. Characters 
#' may be used multiple times. For instance, if \code{y} is used for the year,
#' \code{yy} might produce \code{99}, whereas \code{yyyy} produces \code{1999}.
#' For most numerical fields, the number of characters specifies
#' the field width. For example, if \code{h} is the hour, \code{h} might
#' produce \code{5}, but \code{hh} produces \code{05}.
#' For some characters, the count specifies whether an abbreviated
#' or full form should be used, but may have other choices, as given below.
#' 
#' Two single quotes represents a literal single quote, either
#' inside or outside single quotes. Text within single quotes 
#' is not interpreted in any way (except for two adjacent single quotes).
#' Otherwise all ASCII letter from \code{a} to \code{z} and \code{A} to \code{Z}
#' are reserved as syntax characters, and require quoting if 
#' they are to represent literal characters. In addition, certain 
#' ASCII punctuation characters may become variable in the future
#' (eg \code{:} being interpreted as the time separator and \code{/}
#' as a date separator, and replaced by respective
#' locale-sensitive characters in display).
#' 
#' TO DO: add table / formats
#' 
#' TO DO: add examples
#'
#' @param time a \code{POSIXct} object
#' @param format single string, see Details; defaults to the ISO 8601 guideline
#' @param tz t.b.d
#' @param locale \code{NULL} or \code{""} for default locale,
#' or a single string with locale identifier; a non-Gregorian calendar
#' may be specified by setting \code{@@calendar=name} keyword
#' @param usetz this argument is purposely ignored
#'
#' @return
#' Returns a character vector.
