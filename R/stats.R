#' General statistics for a Character Vector
#' 
#' This function gives general statistics on the whole character vector.
#' Such input vector will often be a text file loaded via the
#' \code{\link{readLines}} function, where each text line
#' is represented by a separate string.
#' 
#' 
#' @param str character vector to aggregate
#' @return An integer vectors with the following named elements:
#' \enumerate{
#'    \item \code{Lines} - number of lines (number of 
#'    not-\code{NA} strings in the vector)
#'    \item \code{LinesNEmpty} - number of lines with at least 
#'    one non-\code{WHITE_SPACE} character [WHITE_SPACE binary property....]
#'    \item \code{Chars} - number of Unicode code points 
#'    (total lengths of strings)
#'    \item \code{CharsNWhite} - number of Unicode code points 
#'    that are  not \code{WHITE_SPACE}s
