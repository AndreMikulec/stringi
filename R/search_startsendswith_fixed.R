#' @title
#' Determine if the Start or End of a String Matches a Fixed Pattern
#'
#' @description
#' These functions check if a string starts or ends with a fixed
#' pattern occurence.
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str}, \code{pattern},
#' and \code{from} or \code{to}.
#'
#' For natural language processing this function might not give
#' you desired results. Refer to \link{stringi-search-fixed} for more details.
#'
#' If \code{pattern} is empty, then the result is \code{NA}
#' and a warning is generated.
#' 
#' Argument \code{start} controls the start position in \code{str}
#' at which \code{pattern} is mathed.
#' On the other hand, \code{to} gives the end position.
#' 
#' Indices given by \code{from} or \code{to} are 1-based,
#' i.e. an index equal to 1 denotes the first character
#' in a string, which gives a typical R look-and-feel.
#'
#' For negative indices in \code{from} or \code{to}, counting starts
#' at the end of the string. E.g. index -1 denotes the last code point
#' in the string.
#'
#' @param str character vector
#' @param pattern character vector
#' @param from integer vector
#' @param to integer vector
#'
#' @return Returns a logical vector.
