stringi Package installation & building



On Linux:


cd src/
./configure
make
make install

(default settings are OK)


Perhaps this could also be needed:

[edit] /etc/ld.so.conf

or:

ln -s /usr/local/lib/libicuuc.so.50 /usr/lib
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libicui18n.so.50  /usr/lib
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libicudata.so.50  /usr/lib
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libicuio.so.50 /usr/lib
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libicule.so.50 /usr/lib


Ferora:
   you may try with `yum install libicu-devel`
   however, it may give you an outdated version of the ICU library
