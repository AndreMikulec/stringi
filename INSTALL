The stringi package depends on the ICU4C >= 50 library.
If you build the package from sources and either:
* these requirements are not met (checkout e.g. the 'libicu-devel' package
   on RedHat/Fedora or 'libicu-dev' on Ubuntu),
* pkg-config cannot find proper build settings, or
* R CMD INSTALL is called with --configure-args='--disable-pkg-config',
then the library will be built together with stringi
(a custom subset of ICU4C 52.1 is shipped with stringi).

Important note to Solaris/SPARC and other "big-endian systems" users:
we are not shipping the ICU Data Library for non-little-endian
systems with stringi (the data set size quite large: 10-20 MB).
The package may be loaded cleanly without it, but
some features will be unavailable (like encoding conversion,
collation etc.). On such systems an appropriate icudt52b.dat
file should be manually copied into the libs/ subdirectory in the installed
package path (see find.package('stringi')). The file may be downloaded from
http://static.rexamine.com/packages/icudt52b.zip.


The user is encouraged to check whether the data library
has been successfully installed by calling:

> library('stringi')
> stri_enc_list() # this should return a list of length > 0
> stri_locale_list() # this should return a vector of length > 0

Also, to make sure that ICU has detected your locale and native
encoding properly, call:

> stri_info(short=TRUE)
