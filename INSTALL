The stringi package depends on the ICU4C >= 50 library.
If you build the package from sources and either:

* these requirements are not met (check out http://site.icu-project.org/download
   or e.g. the `libicu-devel` rpm package on Fedora or `libicu-dev` on Ubuntu),

* `pkg-config` is not able to find proper build settings for ICU-based projects,
or

* R CMD INSTALL is called with `--configure-args='--disable-pkg-config'`,

then the library will be built together with stringi
(a custom subset of ICU4C 52.1 is shipped with the package).
In such a case, if you already downloaded an appropriate version of
`icudt*.zip`, you may wish to install the package by calling:
`install.packages("stringi", configure.vars="ICUDT_DIR=<dir_to_copy_icudt_from>")`.
Otherwise, the ICU data library will be downloaded from one of our mirror servers.

You are encouraged to check whether the ICU data library (`icudt`)
has been successfully installed by calling:

    > library('stringi')
    > stri_install_check()

This is also to ensure that ICU has detected your locale and native
encoding properly.
