The stringi package depends on the ICU4C >= 52 library.
If you build the package from sources and either:

* these requirements are not met (check out http://site.icu-project.org/download
   or e.g. the `libicu-devel` rpm package on Fedora or `libicu-dev` on Ubuntu),

* `pkg-config` is not able to find proper build settings for ICU-based projects,
or

* R CMD INSTALL is called with `--configure-args='--disable-pkg-config'`,

then the library will be built together with stringi
(a custom subset of ICU4C 55.1 is shipped with the package).
By default, the ICU data library will be downloaded from one of our mirror servers.
However, if you have already downloaded a version of `icudt*.zip`
suitable for your platform (big/little endian), you may wish to install
the package by calling:

    install.packages("stringi", configure.vars="ICUDT_DIR=<dir_to_copy_icudt_from>")

You are encouraged to check whether the ICU data library (`icudt`)
has been successfully installed by calling:

    library('stringi')
    stri_install_check()

This is also to ensure that ICU has detected your locale and native
encoding properly.

Also do note that for R >= 3.1.0  we require (by default) C++11 support
to build the package from sources. This is because ICU4C uses the `long long`
type in a few functions, and this is not part of the C++98 standard. Yet, if
your compiler does not support C++11 but you are sure it tolerates the
`long long` type (which is very common -- this will be checked by the
`configure` script anyway), you may disable the C++11 usage by passing
the `--disable-cxx11` flag to the `configure` script.


Auxiliary `./configure` features and options:

* `--disable-cxx11`: Disable use of C++11; if you build ICU4C from
   sources, make sure your C++ compiler supports the long long type.
* `--disable-pkg-config`: Disable pkg-config usage for finding ICU4C-devel; in
  such a case ICU4C will be compiled from sources.
* `--enable-gcc-debug`: Enable -UNDEBUG when compiling stringi (for stringi
  developers)
* `--enable-gcc-pedantic`: Enable -Wall -Wextra -ansi -pedantic when compiling
  stringi with gcc/clang (for stringi developers)
* `--with-extra-cflags=FLAGS: Additional C compiler flags (except for those
  indicated by `R CMD config`)
* `--with-extra-cppflags=FLAGS: Additional C/C++ preprocessor flags (except for
  those indicated by `R CMD config`)
* `--with-extra-cxxflags=FLAGS: Additional C++ compiler flags (except for those
  indicated by `R CMD config`)
* `--with-extra-ldflags=FLAGS`: Additional linker flags (except for those
  indicated by `R CMD config`)

Some influential environment variables:

* `R_HOME`: Override default directory with R installation, e.g.,
  `/usr/lib64/R`. Note that `$R_HOME/bin/R` should point to the R
  executable.
* `ICUDT_DIR`: Optional directory from which an already downloaded ICU data
  archive (`icudt*.zip`) may be copied; either an absolute path or a
  path relative to `<package source dir>/src`; defaults to `icu55/data`.
* `CAT`: the `cat` command used for generating the list of source files
  to compile
