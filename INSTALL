The current version of stringi compiles the ICU4C 52.1 library
even on systems that do have one installed, thus it does not have any
special external dependencies. This is motivated by a few reasons:
* convenient building on Windows and OS X;
* some features of stringi depend on the functionality provided
  by very recent versions of ICU, and many UNIX/Linux distributions
  provide quite old ones;
* the ICU Data Library provided with stringi (see below) guarantees that
  each user of the package has access to the same string processing facilities.

Important note to Solaris/SPARC and other "big-endian systems" users:
we are not shipping the ICU Data Library for non-little-endian
systems with stringi (the data set size is 10-20 MB).
On such systems an appropriate icudt52xx.dat file should be manually
copied into the libs/ subdirectory in the installed package file tree.
In case of any problems with obtaining or installing such a file,
please contact the package maintainer.

The user is encouraged to check whether the data library
has been successfully installed by calling:

> library('stringi')
> stri_enc_list() # this should return a list of length > 0
> stri_locale_list() # this should return a vector of length > 0

Also, to make sure that ICU has detected your locale and native
encoding properly, call:

> stri_info(short=TRUE)
